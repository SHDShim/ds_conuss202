Purpose
=======

Assist CONUSS fitting.  This works only for CONUSS ver. 2.0.2.

How to structure your directory
===============================

My_Project -- ds_conuss202.py
           |
           -- 15GPa -- Data_file.dat10, Input_in, In_*, ...
           |
           |
           -- 20GPa
           ...


How to start
============

0. Run ipython.

1. Run

import os
sys.path.append('~/python/ds_conuss')

2. Import using `from ds_conuss202 import *`.

3. Move to the subdirectory where you have data.

How to setup input files
========================

0. In `in_kfit`, change `exp. data file`.

1. In `in_kref`, change `material data input file`.

2. In `in_kref`, change thickness.

How to conduct CONUSS work
==========================

0. open the input file, data file, and in_kref in a text editor

1. For search, run:

    search()

    * search(alarm=True, plot_result=True, print_result=True)

2. For calculate mossbauer spectrum, run:

    guess()

    * guess(plot_data=True)

3. For fitting, run:

    fit()

    * fit(alarm=True, print_result=True, plot_result=True)

Logging information
===================

`search()`` and `fit()`` make record and backups after execution.
They can be found in `backups` subdirectory.
There you can find `conuss_log.txt` file.
This file has all the record about your fitting and searching.
Also, you may find directories named after time.
In case you need to go back to previous fitting, you may use them.
In the `backups` subdirectory, you can also find figures of the fitting with
names after date and time.
